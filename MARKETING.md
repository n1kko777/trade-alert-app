# Marketing research (baseline) — TradePulse Alerts

## Market snapshot (no-network desk research)
- **Category**: Finance → Crypto tools (alerts, scanners, price tracking).
- **Typical competitors**:
  - **General trackers**: CoinMarketCap / CoinGecko (broad market, many features, alert UX varies).
  - **Charting platforms**: TradingView (powerful, complex, heavier onboarding).
  - **Exchange apps**: Bybit / Binance etc. (alerts exist but are tied to the full exchange experience and often require more setup).
  - **Niche alert apps**: “price alerts / pump alerts” style apps (often noisy, limited filtering, inconsistent background behavior).

## Target users
- **Active spot traders** who want “something moved fast” alerts without opening charts.
- **Scalpers / momentum** watchers who care about percent move within a time window.
- Users who prefer **local-first** (no login) and **simple setup**.

## Differentiation (what we can credibly claim)
- **Percent-change alerts in a rolling window** (not just static price levels).
- **Realtime stream or polling** depending on mode (WebSocket vs REST).
- **Background monitoring** (OS-limited, but supported) + local notifications.
- **Noise reduction** via filtering to symbols that have Bybit futures markets.
- **Per-symbol overrides** (threshold/window/cooldown) on top of global settings.
- **Local history** with pruning limits (storage-safe).

## Positioning statement
TradePulse Alerts helps crypto traders catch sudden moves on Bybit spot pairs by notifying them when price changes exceed a chosen percentage within a chosen time window—without logging in, with optional realtime streaming and background monitoring.

## Brand proposal
- **Name**: TradePulse Alerts
- **Tagline**: Percent‑move alerts for Bybit spot
- **Tone**: fast, clear, trader-friendly (no hype).
